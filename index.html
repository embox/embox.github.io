        <p><strong>Embox</strong> is a configurable operating system kernel designed for resource
constrained and embedded systems.</p>

<p>The key feature of Embox is that it can be used at all stages of hardware development with its uses ranging from testing early prototypes in a simulation environment to functioning as a full-featured operating system on the end-user devices.</p>

<p>The project has been started by few employees of Hardware Engineering Department of Lanit-Tercom, Inc. as a part of commercial project in 2009, and soon it was decided to share the code with others. Now the development team consists primarily of students of Saint-Petersburg State University as well as of the founders of the project.</p>
